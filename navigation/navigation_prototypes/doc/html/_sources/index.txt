Quick Links
-----------
.. these links are created automatically, and are useful. You should probably 
   keep them.

* :ref:`modindex` of all files
* :ref:`search`
* :ref:`genindex` of all functions

Summaries of Important Files
----------------------------

.. this creates a table with the file names, links to their individual 
   documentation, and summaries based on the first sentences of their 
   top-of-file docstrings.
   This is a good way to highlight important files, and make sure they're 
   well linked from the home page!
